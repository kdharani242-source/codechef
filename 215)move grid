)
(0,0) on a 
2
2D grid with perpendicular

X and 
Y
Y axes.

You will do the following moves:

first, 
A
A units along positive 
X
X axis
then, 
B
B units along positive 
Y
Y axis
then, 
C
C units along negative

X axis
finally, 
D
D units along negative 
Y
Y axis
Find the coordinates of your final position.


//python
a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
print(a-c,b-d)

//c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int a,b,c,d;
	scanf("%d %d %d %d",&a,&b,&c,&d);
	printf("%d %d",(a-c),(b-d));
