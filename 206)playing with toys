Playing with Toys
Chef got 
N
N toys for his birthday. Everyday, if he has at least one toy with him, he plays with one specific toy for that day.

Unfortunately, Chef is very careless, and will inevitably break that toy by the end of the day. When he does break it, he does not play with a new toy but just waits for the next day.

After 
M
M days, how many toys will Chef be left with?

//SOLUTION
n,m=map(int,input().split())
if(n<=m):
    print(0)
else:
    print(n-m)
//in c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int n,m;
	scanf("%d %d",&n,&m);
	if(n<=m){
	    printf("%d",0);
	}
	else{
	    printf("%d",n-m);
	}

}
