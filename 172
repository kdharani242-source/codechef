Bitcoin Market
Chef has recently started investing in Bitcoin.
He assigns a market risk level 
R
R (from 
1
1 to 
10
10), where:

1
1 means the market is very safe,
10
10 means the market is very risky.
Chef will buy Bitcoin only if the risk level is 
4
4 or less.

Given the current risk level 
R
R, determine whether Chef should buy Bitcoin.




//SOLUTION
//PYTHON
n=int(input())
if(n<=4):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

//C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int n;
	scanf("%d",&n);
	if(n<=4){
	    printf("YES");
	}
	else{
	    printf("NO");
	}
	

}



Print "YES" if Chef should buy, otherwise print "NO".
